<h1>Learning Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project exists to show my learning path in python and help others achieve their goal of learning it as well. I will do my best to walk through the steps I took in my journey and share any relevant code I have along the way.
<br />

<h2>Why I'm Learning Python</h2>
I'm learning Python because it seems like the most user friendly docing language to learn from the beginning. I have an IT background in all facets from helpdesk support to infrastructure design but I'm ready to expand my knowledge. I heard someone say one time that I'd be doing myself a disseervice by not learning Python, so here I am to learn and grow.
